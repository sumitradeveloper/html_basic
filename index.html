  <h1>Pets for our Homes</h1>
  
  <p class=para1>A pet is a domesticated animal that lives with people, but is not forced to work and is not eaten, in most instances. 
      In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal 
      shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be euthanized.
      The most common types of pets are:
    </p>

      <ul>
          <li>Dogs</li>
          <li>Cats</li>
          <li>Birds</li>
          <li>Fish</li>
          <li>Donkeys</li>
          <li>Oxen</li>
      </ul>
<p class=para2>
    Pets provide their owners (or "guardians") both physical and emotional benefits. Walking a dog can provide both the human and 
    the dog with exercise, fresh air and social interaction. Pets can give companionship to people who are living alone or elderly 
    adults who do not have adequate social interaction with other people. There is a medically approved class of therapy animals, 
    mostly dogs or cats, that are brought to visit confined humans, such as children in hospitals or elders in nursing homes. 
    Pet therapy utilizes trained animals and handlers to achieve specific physical, social, cognitive or emotional goals with patients.
